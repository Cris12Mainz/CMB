#This project is about how to plot the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Power Spectrum in the Early Universe.\\
#There is one folder called "output" where you can find the Power Spectrum of the CMB for many models and the code that has been used to plot them.\\
#Also, there is a file called "Explanatory.ini" where you can find the values of the parameters that describe the Early Universe. 
#This code needs more files to be run, and you can find it in the "Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS)" -> https://lesgourg.github.io/class_public/class.html\\
#You can find the report of the project in CMB.pdf
